        A function that encodes a given string using a simplified form of caesar cipher (without using modulo). Every character of the string will be 
        transformed into the ordinal/numerical representation and encoded by shifting the number with self.caesar_shift 
        (through addition). Afterward, the shifted numbers are transformed into bitstring representation.

        For example, suppose we want to encode the message 'hello' with a caesar shift of 5. 
        The corresponding encoded message (output of this function) would be '1101101 1101010 1110001 1110001 1110100'. Note that the 
        number of bitstrings separated by spaces is equal to the number of characters of the string 'hello'. 
        Let's look at the first character 'h'. Its ordinal representation is 104. We shift its representation by 5, giving us 109. 
        109 is then transformed into a bitstring, which gives us 1101101 (the first bitstring in the encoded message). 

        Hints: the following built-in Python functions may be of use
          - ord(x): takes a character x as input and returns the ordinal representation

        Thus, make sure design a proper divide and conquer strategy for this. A too simplistic strategy (search over every cell in the grid)
